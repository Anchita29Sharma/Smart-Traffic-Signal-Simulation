# 🚦 Smart Traffic Signal Simulation

A Python-based smart traffic signal simulation system that dynamically allocates green time based on traffic density, emergency vehicles, and downstream congestion (spillback prevention).

## 🔹 Features
- Dynamic green time allocation
- Emergency vehicle priority
- Traffic density classification
- Countdown-based signal simulation
- Spillback prevention (downstream capacity awareness)
- Traffic visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## 🔹 Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 🔹 How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib seaborn

3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
